# What is this?

This repo is where I store some scripts, allowing me to quickly install these useful tools on different computers.


## Current Script Collection

- **YouTube Favorites Cleanup** - Adds a convenient "Delete All" button to YouTube's favorites list, allowing you to remove all saved videos with a single click instead of tediously removing them one by one.

## Installation

1. First, install the Tampermonkey extension:
   - [Chrome Download Link](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo)
   - [Firefox Download Link](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/)

2. Just copy the script content and paste it into Tampermonkey.
